Pirate Software Jam. The idea is some kind of dual game, where one side is
action and the other side is more strategy/logistics, and doing well in one
allows you to do better in the other.

So what's the first thing that we can work on there? We can either do the day
mode or the night mode. I like the night mode being something where you get
the shadows to follow you or something like that. Whatever it is, it should be
something that works well with having different kinds of upgrades.

I also would like there to be something similar with the mechanics. The
automation eventually doesn't matter exactly what is being done, just that it
is being automated. So having something like similar mechanics could be kinda
cool.

Okay, that was kinda fun. But now we actually have to make the things right?
What do we make first? Which mode. I think it has to be the day mode.
